We build the app to be user friendly and without a subscription. This interface will appeal to the individuals whom want to visualize and impliment a visual goals board on a technical platform. The functionality of attaching the users personal choice of visual with a notes section that can be manipulated and adapted fascilitates a multifunctional experience.

## Testing
AS a user that enjoys keeping track of their goals ona Pinterest like board, I WANT to search for pictures SO THAT I can build a deck of goals, GIVEN an option to search for pictures, WHEN I select which type of picture I want to search for, then I am presented with a list of options, WHEN the results are returned, then I can view pictures of what I searched, WHEN I click on the picture I pin, then I can view all notes, goals, to-do list and priorities planned. I can then save that picture, WHEN I click on the search, then I am presented with all of the pictures in that specific class, WHEN the results are returned, then I can view details of that goal, WHEN I want to view the entire board, then I am presented with a pop up page that holds all saved notes etc, WHEN I want to remove a picture/board, then I can click a button to remove any picture/page from my board.
